# README

This README documents how to get annie-walsh.com up and running. It is a personal portfolio website. No db but a rails app nonethless. Built entirely in Tailwind and ruby of course. 

Things I may want to cover:

* Ruby version - whatever the latest is

* System dependencies - not much

* Configuration - deploys to RENDER automatically when pushing to main!****

* Database creation -N/A

* Database initialization - N/A

* How to run the test suite - there is none yet but would be good to practice testing with some. I'll get on that.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.) -  no services, very simple site.

* Deployment instructions - push to main

* Have fun bye
